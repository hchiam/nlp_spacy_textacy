# [NLP](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/natural_language_processing#English) with spaCy and textacy

I got code snippets from: https://medium.com/@ageitgey/natural-language-processing-is-fun-9a0bff37854e
I figured out install instructions that worked for me from: https://github.com/explosion/spaCy

```
pip install spacy
pip install textacy
spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m spacy validate
```
